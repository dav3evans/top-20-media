# Top 20 Media Explorer

This is my submission for the top 20 media explorer! I've covered the 4 main requirements, though unfortunately wasn't able to move onto the bonus points. I hoped to, but time got away from me. If I can get this done prior to the technical discussion, I'm more than happy to go through it, but wouldn't expect it to be considered part of this submission.

There's certainly more than a few things I'd like to improve/change in this. I'm looking forward to going through that with you all.

Thanks! Dave ðŸ¤˜

## âœ… Requirements Covered

1. **Data Fetching**

- Utilizes the iTunes Search API to fetch the top 20 items for each of the following media types:
  - Albums
  - Audiobooks
  - Podcasts

2. **User Interface**

- Clean, intuitive, and responsive design.
- Page structure clearly presents the three media lists.
- Each item displays relevant information such as:
  - Artwork
  - Title
  - Artist/Author

3. **Functionality**

- **Search**: A single search bar allows users to search across all three media types simultaneously. Lists update in real-time.
- **Filtering**: Users can filter displayed content by media type (e.g., show only albums, or albums and podcasts).

4. **Accessibility**

- The application is built with accessibility in mind, including:
  - Semantic HTML
  - Keyboard navigability
  - Appropriate ARIA attributes
  - Sufficient color contrast
